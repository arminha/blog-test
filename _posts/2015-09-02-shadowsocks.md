["Two days ago the police came to me and wanted me to stop working on this"](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-iOS/issues/124#issuecomment-133630294) - The code of shadowsocks, a secure socks5 proxy, has been removed due to pressure from the Chinese government. The GitHub [repository](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks) is now empty. Good that GitHub still keeps the [history](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/tree/5b450acfaa15cd6c2d3e8ab99f9297542df74025) :)

There's also a discussion on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10101469) and a [backup of all repos](https://github.com/ShadowsocksBackup).
