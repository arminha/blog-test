The Citizen Lab issued a [detailed report](https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/) on the recent [DDoS attacks on GitHub and GreatFire.org]({% post_url 2015-04-03-sealing-off-holes-in-the-great-firewall %}).
They identified a new tool, called the "Great Cannon" that is co-located with the Great Firewall.

>The Great Cannon is not simply an extension of the Great Firewall, but a distinct attack tool that hijacks traffic to (or presumably from) individual IP addresses, and can arbitrarily replace unencrypted content as a man-in-the-middle.
